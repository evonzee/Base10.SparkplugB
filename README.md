# Base10.SparkplugB

[![dotnet test](https://github.com/evonzee/Base10.SparkplugB/actions/workflows/dotnet-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/evonzee/Base10.SparkplugB/actions/workflows/dotnet-test.yml)

This package is a .NET6+ implementation of the Sparkplug B industrial automation protocol.  

While there are other great .NET Sparkplug libraries available (see SeppPenner/SparkplugNet), I only needed protocol version B on .NET 6+, and I needed spec v3 compatibility ASAP.  Rather than providing extra functionality, my goal is to provide the basic necessities as the core and allow extra capabilities to be built on top, which I hope will result in faster development.
